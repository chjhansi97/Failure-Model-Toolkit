Failure Analysis Toolkit for ML Models
Overview

Machine learning models often fail silently. Overall accuracy may look stable while performance degrades for specific data segments, time periods, or feature ranges.

This project provides a failure analysis toolkit that helps identify where, when, and under what conditions a trained machine learning model fails by analyzing prediction outcomes across structured data slices.

The focus is on post-model analysis, not model training or optimization.
