# Failure-Model-Toolkit

## This project focuses on analyzing predictions from an already trained machine learning model to identify systematic failure patterns across data slices such as time, feature ranges, and labels.

#In Scope
##In-Scope

## The project will include:

## Analysis of classification model predictions on tabular data

## Definition of model failure based on prediction correctness

## Data slicing across:

## Time or batch identifiers

## Feature-based bins (quantiles or categories)

## Class labels

## Computation of slice-level performance metrics

## Identification of failure hotspots where error rates are significantly higher than baseline

## Generation of visualizations and a summary failure analysis report

#Out-of-Scope
## The project will not include:

## Model training, tuning, or architecture design

## Deep learning or neural network models

## Real-time or streaming analysis

## Automatic model retraining or remediation

## Causal inference or counterfactual explanations

## Large language model integration

#Target User

##Data scientists or machine learning engineers who need to debug, analyze, or monitor model performance in production or batch environments.
